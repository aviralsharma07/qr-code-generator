# QR Code Generator

In this Project I learned,

1. To get a random Image and view it on the Window.
2. To Use explicitly add Classes to HTML elements using `classList.add()` in JS
3. To use `animation` property in CSS and set keyframes for it:
   
   ```
   animation: name duration timing-function iteration-count;
   ```

   - **name:** Specifies the name of the keyframe animation.
   - **duration:** Specifies the duration of the animation in seconds or milliseconds.
   - **timing-function (optional):** Specifies the timing function to control the pace of the animation.
   - **iteration-count (optional):** Specifies the number of times the animation should repeat.
